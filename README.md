# Lee_Lab_Metadata
This was a project I worked on as an undergraduate research assistant at Lee Lab under the Department of Molecular Microbiology and 
Immunology at USC's Keck School of Medicine during the summer of 2019.
  
  
The purpose of the project is to allow researchers (particularly those studying HIV/AIDS)
to effectively pool together their research data samples, or medical records from already published papers, into an organized, comprehensive database. Researchers are able to upload files to the backend, which would automatically clean up and insert the data from the files into a MySQL database. They are also able to query the database using the intuitive frontend of the project, which will then display any matching data as a table directly on the webpage. A user could then download any selected columns of the returned table into a csv file.
  
The website is live on p512.usc.edu/metadata. However, it is still undergoing testing and changes to adjust to new project requirements, so there may be some unexpected new elements or parts that seem buggy, but the overall function and layout should still be fairly similar to the original website from the code in this repository. Please refrain from uploading any new files as well.
